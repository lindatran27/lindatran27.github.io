                <li>Yes - the page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file</li>

                <ul>

            </ol>
            <li>Yes - Page contains the header, main, and footer.</li>
            <li>Yes - Only the Home page has site header with text in h1, may need to add that for the rest.</li>
            <li>No - may need to implement a h2 for the pages</li>
            <li>No - Does not contain brand tagline</li>
            <li>Yes - Has a footer but does not contain html/css validation buttons.</li>
            <li>Yes - Mostly meets the requirements, except two pages are missing. Other than that, looks good!</li>
