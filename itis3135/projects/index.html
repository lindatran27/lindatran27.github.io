        <h2>Looking to get a new set of nails? </h2>
        <p>New York Nails has you covered! Established in 2005 at South Blvd, 
            Hanh has been in the nail salon business for a long time.
            Whether it's old school or new school (as to what Hanh describes the two styles her client mentions), Hanh is able to work with many 
            designs her client wants. Long or short nails, doesn't matter!
