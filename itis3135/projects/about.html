            <p>Hanh has been working as a nail technician since she was in her early 20s. She first started in New Jersey
                before moving down here in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hanh loves working on her loyal clients' nails
                and always strives for perfection. Any client will say that one main thing they like about Hanh
                is how she cares for her clients and always makes sure to give the client what they want. While Hanh 
                is not with New York Nails anymore, you can still book an appointment with her at Lee Spa's Nails.
