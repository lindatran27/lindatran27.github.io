        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Born and raised in Charlotte, NC, I am the middle child of the siblings! 
                But I’m technically the oldest for my two younger siblings as I have two older sisters who live in New Jersey.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have participated in tech internships for Road2Hire & 
                GDS during 2019, 2021, and 2023. I currently work as a part-time retail associate 
                for a popular discount store.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  When I was a junior in high school, I was unsure on what I 
                wanted to do for a career. I decided to give web development a try after attending 
                an interest meeting for Road2Hire and fell in love with the learning and creativity that goes along with web development.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>  I have built websites from past internship experiences and also attended an after school web design class back in high school.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  Windows 11</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GEOL 1200 - Physical Geology:</strong> Taking it as an elective course, also the subject is interesting.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development:</strong> Required for concentration, but also interesting!</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3200 - Introduction to Info Security & Priv:</strong> Required for concentration</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 4350 - Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Required for concentration, but also really interested in taking 
                        it for this semester after taking Human-Centered Design back in Spring.</li>
                    <li><strong>MATH 1165 - Intro to Discrete Structures:</strong> Required for concentration</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I share the same birthday (8/27) with my uncle. 
                My go-to drink when ordering at a cafe would be an iced chai latte, it’s really delicious.</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>  I went to my first concert back in April for Mac Ayres, he’s a really 
                cool musical artist!</li>
