        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3 class="website"><a href="https://weather.com/">The Weather Channel</a></h3>
        <p>The first website I will be evaluating is from The Weather Channel. Everyone uses 
            The Weather Channel app on their phone to check the weather (Unless you're different).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The website has a dark background with sections contrasting it with a 
                light background. This makes it easy for the user to look at the weather or any news articles.</li>
            <li>Repetition: The website has a consistent style by using the same font style and keeps a pattern 
                for the text and background to have contrasting colors. </li>
            <li>Alignment: The arrangement of the sections on the website is well done, The main content of the 
                page is aligned in the center, with smaller sections having equal portions of space. The main content 
                has both large and small sections of the content aligned well to have equal space on both the left 
                and right side of the page.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The main story of the website is displayed large and centered on the page, while smaller sections 
                are placed on the right. While important links are placed above in the navigation bar.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="website"><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">LINGsCARS</a></h3>
        <p>The second website I will be evaluating is from LINGsCARS, a car dealership in 
            the United Kingdom. It's a very interesting website to look at. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Poor color scheme chosen, the extreme contrast for most of the elements on the page makes it hard 
                for the user to view the website and stay interested. The background of the page has a busy pattern going on, 
                which can be distracting for the user's eyes.</li>
            <li>Repetition: While there is consistency for font style and how the main content is organized, 
                there is no consistent color scheme. It's like the person took all of the colors from the rainbow 
                and splashed it on the page itself.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Poor alignment showcased on the website, some sections of the website are not aligned well. </li>
            <li>Proximity: Each section for each car are too close to each other, whitespace is not being used efficiently. 
                Instead, there's way too much once you scroll down past the main stuff.</li>
        </ul>
